# Data science portfolio by Carlos Fernandes

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks with data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Natural language processing.

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb)

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

### NLP with Python: exploring Fate/Zero

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Fate_Zero_explore.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Fate_Zero_explore.ipynb)

Natural language processing in machine learning helps to accomplish a variety of tasks, one of which is extracting information from texts. This notebook is an overview of several text exploration methods using English translation of Japanese light novel "Fate/Zero" as an example.

### NLP. Text generation with Markov chains

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Markov_chain_nlp.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Markov_chain_nlp.ipynb)

This notebook shows how a new text can be generated based on a given corpus using an idea of Markov chains. I start with simple first-order chains and with each step improve model to generate better text.

### NLP. Text summarization

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Summarize.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Summarize.ipynb)

This notebook shows how text can be summarized choosing several most important sentences from the text. I explore various methods of doing this based on a news article.

## Machine Learning

### Clustering with KMeans

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb)

Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).

## Data exploration and analysis

### Telematic data

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb)

I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the notebook. I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.
