# Data science portfolio by Carlos Fernandes

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks with data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Machine Learning & NLP

### NLP. Text summarization

[Github](nawger.com)

This notebook shows how text can be summarized choosing several most important sentences from the text. I explore various methods of doing this based on a news article.

### 3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets

[Github](nawger.com)

3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

### Audio to Speech

[Github](nawger.com)

### Language Translator

## Data exploration and analysis

### Telematic data

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb)

I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the notebook. I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.
